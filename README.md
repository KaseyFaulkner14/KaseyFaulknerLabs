# Summary of Files

The 3 files provided above are media arts labs by me, Kasey Faulkner. 
The products of Lab 4 and Lab 8 are quite similar, having the same concept of a moving car. 
They show a difference in the requirements, with Lab 4 being animation-focused and Lab 8 being visually-focused through photos.
Meanwhile, Lab 7, which had a variety of shape-related requirments, along with for loops, created a ship in a stormy sea.
I'm very proud of the rain animation I made in Lab 7.

I hope you enjoy these programs I've created!
